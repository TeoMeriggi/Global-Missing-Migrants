# Global Missing Migrants Dataset Dashboard

## Overview

This project features a Tableau dashboard created using the [Global Missing Migrants Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-missing-migrants-dataset/data), which provides a comprehensive record of missing migrants and their tragic journeys towards international destinations. The dataset is collected by the Missing Migrants Project, an initiative implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) since 2014. It documents deaths, disappearances, and the challenges migrants face during their journeys.
